  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the

  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints

  # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/index.html.

  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
